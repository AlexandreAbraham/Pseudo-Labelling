# Pseudo-Labelling
Pseudo Labelling on MNIST dataset

This was my first attempt on implementing semi supervised learning through pseudo labelling, which proved to be problematic and I didn't achieve the desired improvement in my model. They are two different jupyter notebook files, one achieves a maximum 3 percent of increase in accuracy and the other one seems to be failing to achieve any improvements
