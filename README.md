# Pseudo-Labelling
Pseudo Labelling on MNIST dataset

They are three different jupyter notebook files, one seems to be failing to achieve any improvements (Pseudo-Labelling-MNIST-1st), the second one achieves a maximum 7 percent increase of accuracy (Pseudo-Labelling-MNIST-2nd) and the third model, which relies on augemntation, an increase of 14 percent (Pseudo-Labelling-MNIST-3rd)
